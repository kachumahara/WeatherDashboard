### WEATHER DASHBOARD
Instruction: To build an open weather App using openweather API.

I used html, css and javascript

When the user inputs a city to search, current weather conditons for that city are displayed with a 5-Day weather forecast of that city. If the user searches for another city, the previous city will be added underneath the search bar. In the current weather conditon displayed, the user will be presented with UV Index, temperature, wind speed, humidity.
